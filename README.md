# Description :

This project was generated using Angular version 18.1.1, with the layout styled using Tailwind CSS. It focuses on creating a responsive design for a QR Code component. I practiced one-way data binding, using string interpolation for the title and description, and property binding for the image. I have attached the live website in the description of this repository.
